# Note Taker Starter Code



The application’s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

Getting Started
The application should have a db.json file on the back end that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the fs module.

The following HTML routes should be created:

GET /notes should return the notes.html file.

GET * should return the index.html file.

The following API routes should be created:

GET /api/notes should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON.

POST /api/notes should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).

Bonus
You haven’t learned how to handle DELETE requests, but this application has that functionality in the front end. As a bonus, see if you can add the DELETE route to the application using the following guideline:

DELETE /api/notes/:id should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
