User Story:
AS A small business owner, I WANT to be able to write and save notes SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

My experience building this application was overall positive, and I mostly struggled with navigating through the various methods that could be used to get each step completed. I referenced a lot of similar code while planning out the application which was helpful, but also confusing. One of the biggest things I learned was the importance of file organization, and how seperating the content make's it much easier to navigate.
